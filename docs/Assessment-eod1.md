# Assessment of Session Types Codebase (Updated)

---

## Code Quality

**Tags:** idiomatic, modular, clear, extensible, type-safe  
**Score:** 8.5/10

- Well-structured and idiomatic Rust.
- Good use of type-level programming and traits.
- Macros improve ergonomics.
- Minor improvements possible in constructor privacy and error reporting.


---

## Completeness of Implementation (MPST Features & Protocol Correctness)

**Tags:** foundational, extensible, binary/n-ary, partial-mpst, safe  
**Score:** 6/10

- Core global protocol specification is present.
- No global/projection machinery yet (local types, endpoint codegen, etc.).
- No runtime choreography (by design, for now).

---

## Implementation Code (Corner Cases, Features, DX, Cleanliness)

**Tags:** ergonomic, clean, maintainable, macro-powered, safe  
**Score:** 8/10


- Macros and type-level lists make n-ary combinators ergonomic.
- Compile-time assertions for type equality.
- No dead code or unused imports.
- Disjointness checks for `TPar` are planned but not yet implemented.
- Compile-time error messages could be improved for DX.

---

## Documentation

**Tags:** needs-examples, needs-human-docs, academic-leaning, improvable  
**Score:** 4.5/10

- Lacks comprehensive, developer-friendly examples.
- Doc comments are present but need improvement from a human/developer perspective.
- No README or standalone documentation yet.
- Needs a clear, non-academic explanation of session types and their utility.
- Plan to add module-level docs, a README, and more usage scenarios.

---

## Additional Notes

- **Global/Projection Machinery:**  
  - The current codebase is focused on global protocol specification only (purely declarative, no runtime).
  - When adding projections, care must be taken to balance DX and the integration of generated vs. handwritten code.
  - Binary types and duality are straightforward; local runtime choreography will be the main challenge.
  - The global API should be finalized before tackling projections and runtime aspects.

---

**Overall:**  
A strong and extensible foundation for global session types in Rust.  
**Highest priorities:**  
- Improve documentation and examples for real-world developers.
- Plan and implement global-to-local projection machinery with careful attention to developer experience.
