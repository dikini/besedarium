//! # Protocol Base Types and Traits
//!
//! This module provides the foundational types and traits for building
//! protocol types in the Besedarium library. It includes:
//!
//! - Type-level list primitives (`Nil`, `Cons`)
//! - Core marker traits
//! - Base implementations for type-level operations
//!
//! These types form the foundation for the type-level programming patterns
//! used throughout the protocol system.

use core::marker::PhantomData;

/// # Type-Level Map/Fold Pattern
///
/// Many traits in this crate use a type-level map/fold pattern to recursively
/// process type-level lists or protocol structures. This is a common idiom for
/// building, transforming, or checking protocol types at compile time.
///
/// ## How it works
/// - The trait is implemented for the base case (usually `Nil`), which provides
///   the default or terminal value.
/// - The trait is then implemented recursively for `Cons<H, T>` (or similar),
///   where the head is processed and the result is combined with the recursive
///   result for the tail.
///
///   Type-level empty list for n-ary combinators and role/label sets.
///   Used as the base case for type-level lists.
pub struct Nil;

/// `Cons<H, T>` is a type-level list node with a head type `H` and a tail type `T`.
///
/// The tail must itself be a type-level list. The implementation typically recursively processes the head and
/// continues the recursion on the tail.
///
/// # Type parameters
///
/// - `H`: The head type in this node
/// - `T`: The tail type-level list
pub struct Cons<H, T>(PhantomData<(H, T)>);

/// Trait to check that all elements in a type-level list are unique.
///
/// Used for compile-time uniqueness assertions (e.g., for protocol labels).
pub trait UniqueList {}

impl UniqueList for Nil {}
impl<H, T> UniqueList for Cons<H, T> where T: NotInList<H> + UniqueList {}

/// Helper trait to check if a type is not in a type-level list.
pub trait NotInList<X> {}

impl<X> NotInList<X> for Nil {}
impl<X, H, T> NotInList<X> for Cons<H, T>
where
    X: NotSame<H>,
    T: NotInList<X>,
{
}

/// Helper trait to check if two types are not the same.
pub trait NotSame<T> {}

impl<A, B> NotSame<B> for A where A: NotTypeEq<B> {}

/// Base trait for type inequality.
/// The default implementation works for all non-identical types.
pub trait NotTypeEq<B> {}

impl<A, B> NotTypeEq<B> for A {}
// Overlap: no impl for A == A (this is intentional)

/// Type-level trait to check if two types are the same.
/// Implemented via a marker type Output that is True or False.
pub trait TypeEq<B> {
    type Output;
